"The Midnight Train"
Page 1:
The midnight air was thick with the smell of rain-soaked earth, the streets gleaming under the flickering lamps. The rumble of the approaching train could be felt in her chest, but her heart raced for different reasons.
She had always been a planner, someone who mapped out every step of her life meticulously. She hadn’t told anyone she was leaving—no goodbyes, no explanation, just a note left on her bedside table.
Anna couldn’t help but steal a glance at the crumpled envelope in her hand. That was enough.
The distant whistle of the train brought her back to the present. This wasn’t a goodbye—it was an escape.

The train screeched to a halt, the old steel wheels grinding against the rails. But now…now he was calling her back, and she didn’t know if it was out of love or danger.
As the train lurched forward, Anna stared out the window, watching the city lights blur into the darkness. The weight of the unknown kept her awake, every creak of the train filling her with restless energy.
She clutched the letter tighter, finally summoning the courage to open it. The familiar handwriting greeted her, and her eyes scanned the words, each one sending a jolt through her.
“Anna,
I know this is sudden, but I need you to trust me. But that was so long ago.
Why now?
As the train began to slow down, approaching a small, forgotten station in the middle of nowhere, Anna realized this was it. Her footsteps echoed on the wooden planks as she made her way toward the edge of the forest.
For a moment, she hesitated. She had to know.
The path to the cabin was overgrown, barely visible in the dim light of the moon. The memories of their time here flooded back—warm summer nights, whispered secrets, stolen kisses.
She reached the clearing, and there it was—the old cabin, just as she remembered it. She reached the door and pushed it open, the creak of the hinges making her flinch.
And there he was.
Luca.

He stood by the fireplace, his silhouette illuminated by the crackling flames. He handed it to her, his fingers brushing against hers, sending a shiver down her spine.
“What is this?” she asked, her voice barely above a whisper.
“Everything I’ve been running from.”
Anna opened the journal, her eyes scanning the pages. It was their story, written in meticulous detail, from the moment they met to the night Luca disappeared.
But it didn’t stop there.
The journal described events that hadn’t happened yet—decisions she hadn’t made, paths she hadn’t walked. It was as if the journal was a map of her future, one she hadn’t agreed to follow.
“What is this?” Anna repeated, her voice trembling.
Luca took a deep breath.
